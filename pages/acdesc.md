Affine invariant image comparison under repetitive structures
===================

*Full Title*: "Affine invariant image comparison under repetitive structures"

*Authors*: Mariano Rodr√≠guez and Rafael Grompone von Gioi

*Conference*: [ICIP 18](https://2018.ieeeicip.org/)

*Abstract*:
We focus on the problem of affine invariant image comparison in the presence of
noise and repetitive structures. The classic scheme of keypoints, descriptors
and matcher is used. A local field of image gradient orientation is used as
descriptor and two matchers are proposed, based on the a-contrario theory, for
handling repetitive structures. The affine invariance is obtained by affine
simulations. The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performances under
repetitive structures.

### Estimating tilt tolerances
In order to estimate the tilt tolerance of AC-Q, AC-W, SIFT, and RootSIFT, under repetitive structures, a MATLAB function in our **Tester source code** was used. The github repository already comes with the image data base proposed in this paper. They are called upon by **"tolerance_test_ICIP.m"** .
