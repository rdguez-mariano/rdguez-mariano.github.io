Fast IMAS with hyper-descriptors
===================
*Journal*: [IPOL](http://www.ipol.im/)

*Abstract*:
To be updated !!!

<center><a href="/pages/hyperdescriptors">See this article on HAL</a></center>



**Links to code and documentation will be soon available !**

#### IMAS code
 - Standalone C++ code for IMAS (as in IPOL) implementing Fast-Affine-{SIFT, RootSIFT, HalfSIFT, SURF}
 - C++ code for IMAS based on OpenCV 3.2 implementing Fast-Affine-{SIFT, RootSIFT, HalfSIFT, SURF, FREAK, LATCH, AKAZE, BRISK, ORB, BRIEF, LUCID, DAISY, AGAST}

#### IMAS on MATLAB
MATLAB code for IMAS. This will run through MEX based on both formers C++ implementations of IMAS.

#### Documentation
Here's a doxygen documentation for both C++ IMAS codes: Standalone and OpenCV.

#### Applications
Soon you will find here some Applications of IMAS

#### Finding near optimal coverings (C++ code)
 C++ code for finding near optimal coverings based on radius (initial visibility) and the region to cover.

 Extract first and then compile in linux with :
 ```bash
 mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make
 ```

 This code doesn't have any documentation available yet but there exist a pseudo-code that has been published in IPOL [(See its web page)](/pages/hyperdescriptors). Executing the program is very simple, the following example in bash is clear enough:
 ```bash
 r=1.6           # radius of disks
 region=4.5      # region to be covered
 N=2             # number of groups of concentric disks

 epsilon=1.025   # Parameter for discretising annulus.
                 # Used to check for covering conditions

 ./opt_covering $r $region $epsilon $N
 ```

 which would return all parameters determining the following near optimal covering. The following image was auto-generated by the above execution of this program.
