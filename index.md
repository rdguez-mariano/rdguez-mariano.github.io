> Hi ! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Gladia.
I was a Postdoctoral researcher at the <a href ="https://centreborelli.cnrs.fr/">Centre Borelli</a>, <a href ="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/">ENS Paris-Saclay</a> and a PhD Student in applied mathematics from 2016-2020 under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan/">Jean-Michel Morel</a> and <a href="https://delon.wp.imt.fr/">Julie Delon</a>.
My academic background is based in Mathematics (undergraduate studies and Master 1) and Computer Science (College and Master 2).
Nowadays my research focuses mainly on Large Language Models, Computer Vision and Machine Learning in general.
