Hi ! I'm a PhD Student at the [ENS Paris-Saclay](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/) under the supervision of [Jean-Michel Morel](https://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan/) and [Julie Delon](https://delon.wp.imt.fr/). My academic background is based in Mathematics (undergraduate studies) and Computer Science (College and masters degree). My research focuses on Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

Please, feel free to take a look around !
